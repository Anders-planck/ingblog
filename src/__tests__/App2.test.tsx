    title: 'Interview with Anders',
    content:
      "<h2><strong>The future of Grafikart</strong></h2><p>The creation of Grafikart is a bit special, because I created it when I was a DUT student, to explain what I'd learned to my fellow students in a simpler way. At the time, the tutorials were related to graphics and design, so they tended to focus on Photoshop, Illustrator and After Effects. To avoid systematically repeating myself, I had created this channel on which I published videos to explain things just once, so that as many people as possible could use them. Eventually, I got into the swing of things and kept doing it, and it became a habit, with the channel growing over time.</p><p>As for the future of Grafikart, it's not necessarily obvious to me because it's always been something I've managed on a day-to-day basis. It's not necessarily a project for which I have any particular ambition or for which I've planned a certain evolution, a certain future. I see it in 10 years' time as it is today, continuing to produce content and, if possible, allocating myself a little more time to try and produce more polished content, always striving to help as many people as possible.</p><p>One of the avenues of development I had envisaged in the past was the translation of certain videos into English, but I've put that project on hold. Firstly, because it would require a lot more work than I'm doing now (I'm already having trouble finding time for French content...). The other concern is that I feel that in English, we already have a lot of resources, and the added value of my channel doesn't seem very relevant to me. Especially since, for the technologies I deal with, there's already quite a lot of content in English <strong>(Laracast, SymfonyCast, FrontEndMaster...)</strong>. And my added value, in my opinion, is French. On the other hand, I'm looking at artificial intelligence and new technologies to see if there are areas in which I can offer automatic translation for those who are interested.</p><h2>My background</h2><p>My educational path was a bit erratic at first. I started with a scientific baccalaureate because at the time I was good at maths <strong><em>(at the time my choice was limited to S, L and ES).</em></strong></p><p>Then I went to a preparatory school (Math Sup), which I successfully failed. And at the end of that year, they advised me to go for an equivalence and I ended up in a licence 2 in mathematics where I failed in the same way (because in fact I wasn't necessarily that good at maths). During that year, I also took the opportunity to give lessons and build up some income so that I could then choose the course I wanted to take. At the time, I wanted to work in 3D and animation, a field where training was very expensive.</p>",
